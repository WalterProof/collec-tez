## Requirements

You need to have the following tools installed:

- yarn
- firebase-tools (optional, used for deployment)
- docker (used for contract development)

## How it works?

A **Makefile** provides some shortcuts to help you. Just run

```bash
$ make
```

to see a help menu.

Local URLs:

- dapp: http://localhost:3000
